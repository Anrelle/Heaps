## Simple Score Tracker

## What is it?

The Simple Score Tracker is a Java program that uses a min-heap to manage scores. It can store scores, find the lowest score, and exit the program.

## What Can It Do
1. **Add Scores**: Users can add scores to the system.  
2. **Get Lowest Score**: Quickly retrieves the smallest score from the heap.  
3. **Exit Program**: Closes the application.

## Why I Made This Application

I made this program to show how a heap works in real life. It helps track scores and always gives the lowest score quickly. This is useful in grading systems or ranking tasks.

### Contribution to the Community
- It Provides a simple implementation for students studying heaps.
- It Can be expanded into more complex systems, like ranking or grading systems.

## How It Works
  ##Add a Score:

• The user inputs a score.

• The score is added to the min-heap.

 ## Get the Lowest Score:

• The program checks if there are any scores.

• If there are scores, it shows the smallest score from the heap.

  ## Exit:

• The program stops when the user chooses to exit.
